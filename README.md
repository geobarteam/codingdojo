# Arduino for Codingdojo
This project contains the material for an Arduino course for beginners. This course is one of the many I use to entertain kids during our coding-dojos sessions.  

Each project is intended to be built in two steps.  First the students can simply follow the schematic and can copy/paste the code theyâ€™ll find by following the provided link.  Then they need to complete a simple assignment consisting in extending what they build in the first step.  To complete the second step they need to make simple changes on the board and in the code.  Hints are provided to help them, so no real coding or electronic know-how is required.

The first project is simply making a led blink, the students should all start with this one.  Once the first assignment done they can choose between three different projects: a love-o-meter, music instrument and a lazer-tag.
